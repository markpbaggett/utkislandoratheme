# Seven - Dlwork

---

These files should only be copied to dlwork's developmental Islandora site.  This makes the admin area for dlwork look differently so that it is not confused with the Administration area of production.

These files do **NOT** go into the /dev/sites/all/themes directory.  Instead, they go into:

    /dev/themes/seven
