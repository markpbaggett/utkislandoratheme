UT Libraries Islandora Theme

---

These are the relavent files from the SIS theme we are using and modifying. There are two sets of directories, each having contents which go the the sites/all/[name] in the drupal installation. If the contents exist in the drupal install already, they do not need to be overwritten. (i.e look in each directory in sites/all/, if there is a directory in the corresponding directory here which is not in the drupal install, then copy it accordingly.)
